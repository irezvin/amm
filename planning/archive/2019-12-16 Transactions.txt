??      Action transaction and response - apply some action on zero, one, many records
        Also: DescribeAction - gets action meta information, Describe - gets record 
        (and mapper? meta-information)

Transactions are created by Mapper.

Amm.Data.Interface implements Transactions.

startTransaction: creates new transaction and begins its execution. Ends when response is set.
