# amm
Advanced multi-model OOP event-based framework written in old-school javascript.

I decided to publish my personal project on GitHub because of invasion to my country (Ukraine); in case if something bad happens with me,
I hope it may be of some interest to anyone.

The project lacks documentation; most of the notes are in planning dir, somthing in docs dir (mostly in Russian).

Examples are in examples/ dir; to build bundle and/or run examples and tests, PHP must be installed.

Probably I will add documentation later.
